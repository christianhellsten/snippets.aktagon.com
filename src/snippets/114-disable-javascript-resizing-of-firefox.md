There is absolutely not a single developer in the world who knows what size I like my browser, although many people think they do. To prevent resizing of FF make the following steps.

1.  Open browser preferences
2.  Choose "Content"
3.  Choose "Advanced" on the "Enable javascript" preference
4.  Untick "Move or resize existing windows"


```bash

```
