To print Vim's startup time:


```bash
$ vim --startuptime /dev/stdout +qall
```
    

Note that this was tested on Vim 7.3.

If you have compiled Vim with profiling enabled ([brew install macvim doesn't](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/macvim.rb)):


```bash
$Â vim --version | grep +profile
```
    

Then you can profile Vim commands as described in this article:
