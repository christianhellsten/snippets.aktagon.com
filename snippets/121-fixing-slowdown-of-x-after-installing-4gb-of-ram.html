After a while of Googling I found [a thread](http://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?t=33821469) that explained why it had become slow. In my dmesg I could see the following error, which hinted me to the cause.


```bash
mtrr: type mismatch for e0000000,10000000 old: write-back new: write-combining
```
    

I want to emphasize that I'm not the author of this script. But I want to store it here because forums and topics sometimes disappear. The original author seems to be "hubick" of the thread linked above. For me this script was plug & play, so many props to the original author if you happen to read this ;) I just needed to run it before X was started.


```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Fixup /proc/mtrr
#
# chkconfig: 12345 0 99
# description: Fixup /proc/mtrr
#
# Save this file as /etc/init.d/mtrrfixup and
# use "chkconfig --add mtrrfixup"
# to have this script run by init when the system starts.
#
# The default mtrr table after boot looks like the following:
# reg00: base=0xd8000000 (3456MB), size= 128MB: uncachable, count=1
# reg01: base=0xe0000000 (3584MB), size= 512MB: uncachable, count=1
# reg02: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
# reg03: base=0x100000000 (4096MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
# reg04: base=0x120000000 (4608MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
# reg05: base=0xd7f80000 (3455MB), size= 512KB: uncachable, count=1
#
# The main problem is entry 1, which covers
# the AGP aperature and Video Card memory.
# Being present and uncachable, it prevents
# the fglrx driver module from using/creating a
# write-combined region for the video card.
# The second problem is entry 2, covering all
# our ram, which prevents us from creating
# any new sections which aren't uncachable.
#
# We have a maximum of 7 mtrr registers.
# All sizes must be a power of two.
# The start and end of any page must
# have the same 'upper bits'.

# First remove all existing values...
# Order matters - wrong order locks system hard!
