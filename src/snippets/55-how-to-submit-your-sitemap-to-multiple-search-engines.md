To submit your sitemap to search engines&mdash;at least Google, MSN and Yahoo support this feature&mdash;add this line to your robots.txt file:


```
Sitemap: http://aktagon.com/sitemap.xml
```
    

This allows the search engine to find your sitemap when it visits your site, which means you don't have to manually register it with each search engine.
