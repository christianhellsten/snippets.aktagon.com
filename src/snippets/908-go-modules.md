> Go modules:

>    - go mod init creates a new module, initializing the go.mod file that describes it.
>    - go build, go test, and other package-building commands add new dependencies to go.mod as needed.
>    - go list -m all prints the current module’s dependencies.
>    - go get changes the required version of a dependency (or adds a new dependency).
>    - go mod tidy removes unused dependencies.
